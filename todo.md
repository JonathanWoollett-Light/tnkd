# todo

- ingenuity seems broken, fix that
- add decisions that allow temporarily occupying territory for expeditions without declaring war
- add more NCR/CES targeted buffs for TNK to help win but not be op
- maybe we can expand the current political paths and move the current econ stuff in the center to under balanced science.
- should add 1 more focus and/or mission before giving claim against each small neighbor that allows a mission to destabilize them so you can beat them early and early war is more viable
- giving territory should give more time
- a new countries (aliens, dwemer and vikings) for expeditions paths
- add NCR and CES war reparation as a mission that decrease industry/military given to TNK over time and they can take decisions to decrease it more.
- use better decisions/mission icons
- angels of death idea icon breaks
- tech for peace decisions are only giving +60 to war time
- shouldn't bypass attacking vegas if you ally them
- should add idea to NCR and CES that prevents them manually declaring war on TNK, should remove after mission timer runs out
- vegas platinum chip focus should require that vegas has completed their platinum chip focus
- should add later focus after allying vegas that allows backstabbing them
- add more narrative events, could add a diplomatic tree where you send crazy robots to annoy other people and give them small debuffs or buffs could be funny
- allying Vegas should give them robotics buff due to think tank knowledge
- research rate is too fast you get through the whole tech tree too fast (maybe but maybe at this point in game everyone finishes tree)
- PP is slightly too hard to get to delay enough, can add a little more PP or some more war delay options
- brain drain icon is broken and might not make sense to be added where its added
- think tank overseers should reduce autonomy of lunar legion
- decohesion idea image is broken
- can we make focus to make tnk overlord of lul start lul with less autonomy
- production efficiency growth should be better
- when ces or ncr no longer exists the decisions category for each shouldn't appear
- lul seems to never train new units likely bug in base mod
- need to add more motivation to engage in earlier wars and have fun as tnk should add extra expeditions which need wars and gives clear good rewards
