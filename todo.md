- Change text from "For now we are an anomaly" with ending "soon we shall be a threat"
tnkd_defensive_infrastructure focus text is broken
- Advanced Robotics is off-center under Tech Ascendance
- Should add focuses to declare war on sky reavers, sleepers and sorrows so not so much downtime, allow focuses to then give away conquered territory for NAP
- Add alternative path to ally House so you don't need to kill him to progress, possibly forming a robotic faction with sleepers
- Change zombie event to give CES chance to not declare war (assuming think tank player RP'd a deal). Event should allow TNK to choose whether to offer CES tech for peace whcih will give -5% consumer TNK +5% consumer CES.
- Zombie focuses images and text are broken
- Should add network buff, so when small very strong but grow weaker as expand
- There's nothing to spend PP on
- Research buff is too strong, you basically finish the tech tree
- Maybe add decision to remove research slots to increase network strenght
