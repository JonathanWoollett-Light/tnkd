- G.E.V should have a nice decision category image
- the carrot focus should trigger an event for each neighbour where we can decide if we want to give them the offer (it doesn't make sense to give an evil faction the offer)

- focus icons for attacking tar walkers and ouroboros are duplicated and wrong. Fix this.
- update ncr and ces peace deal decisions to instead be missions which start when capturing capitols then when timing out trigger the peace deal event (where you choose if peace)
- add decisions that allow temporarily occupying territory for expeditions without declaring war
- add more NCR/CES targeted buffs for TNK to help win but not be op
- should add 1 more focus and/or mission before giving claim against each small neighbor that allows a mission to destabilize them so you can beat them early and early war is more viable
- giving territory should give more time
- a new countries (aliens, dwemer and vikings) for expeditions paths
- add NCR and CES war reparation as a mission that decrease industry/military given to TNK over time and they can take decisions to decrease it more.
- use better decisions/mission icons
- tech for peace decisions are only giving +60 to war time
- should add idea to NCR and CES that prevents them manually declaring war on TNK, should remove after mission timer runs out
- vegas platinum chip focus should require that vegas has completed their platinum chip focus
- should add later focus after allying vegas that allows backstabbing them
- add more narrative events, could add a diplomatic tree where you send crazy robots to annoy other people and give them small debuffs or buffs could be funny
- allying Vegas should give them robotics buff due to think tank knowledge
- research rate is too fast you get through the whole tech tree too fast (maybe but maybe at this point in game everyone finishes tree)
- PP is slightly too hard to get to delay enough, can add a little more PP or some more war delay options
- brain drain icon is broken and might not make sense to be added where its added
- think tank overseers should reduce autonomy of lunar legion
- decohesion idea image is broken
- can we make focus to make tnk overlord of lul start lul with less autonomy
- production efficiency growth should be better
- when ces or ncr no longer exists the decisions category for each shouldn't appear
- lul seems to never train new units likely bug in base mod
- need to add more motivation to engage in earlier wars and have fun as tnk should add extra expeditions which need wars and gives clear good rewards
