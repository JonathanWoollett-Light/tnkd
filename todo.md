- angels of death modifier is broken and doesn't update when the underlying variables change.
- add more NCR/CES targeted buffs for TNK to help win but not be op
- prevent NCR/CES declaring war on TNK without mission timeout
- after war is triggered with either the NCR or the CES a timer should start for war with New Vegas, Sleepers, Sorrows and Sky Reavers
- maybe we can expand the current political paths and move the current econ stuff in the center to under balanced science.
- should add 1 more focus before giving claim against each small neighbor that allows a mission to destabilize them so you can beat them early and early war is more viable
- giving territory should give more time
- increase cover up atrocities time, decrease NCR stability buff
- treaty decisions should require nation still exists
- add mechanic to move industry offmap to deal with tiny territory like lost hills
