### Plans

- Consolidate: Follow the focus tree to build your economy.
- Convergence: A decision category with a missions taking 120 days, a mission should increase the time based on current division count forcing low division counts to make progress. There should also be missions to kill population and pay political power to decrease time. While converging add debuff.

There should be a decision category for each major nation to tell the story of their interaction and a decisions category for all minor nations. Some decisions/missions may be locked behind focuses.

- New Vegas: Pick a focus path whether to ally or conquer. When allying Vegas should be able to
  complete their focus tree. Give decisions to offer concessions to New Vegas (e.g. resource rights,
  ideas etc.) which allow them to finish their focus tree without holding all required territory
  (e.g. Helios One)
- Sleepers: Pick a focus path whether to ally or conquer.
    - Decisions to wake the sleepers which can be started and takes 360 days to complete, missions
      for each border county which speed up timers and mission paying political power to speed up
      timer.
    - Give Sorrows territory.
- Sky Reavers: Border war to take "North Passage"
- NCR: A missions counting down to war.
    - Give land to increase timer.
    - Give idea to increase timer.
    - Demand land and possibly trigger border war which will decrease timer.
    - Cover up atrocities (repeating) to increase timer.
    - Call white-peace this can only be done once, only after 120 days in war and only if you hold
      all territory. This establishes a white peace with the NCR or CES then resets the timer for war.
    - Defeating NCR, when controlling Shady Sands you can end the war taking some territory and
      giving the NCR a debuff idea, resetting the timer.
    - Working with Enclave, can have TNK and Enclave guarantee each other (this disallows white peace option)
    - Split with Enclave, if Shady Sands and (some other territory) is controlled by TNK and Enclave offers decisions to end war splitting NCR territory.
    - Can back a specific CES successor for all others to declare war, significantly increasing timer.
- Caesar's Legion: A missions counting down to war.
    - Give land to increase timer.
    - Give idea to increase timer.
    - Demand land and possibly trigger border war which will decrease timer.
    - Sell slaves (repeating) to increase timer.
    - Call white-peace this can only be done once, only after 120 days in war and only if you hold
      all territory. This establishes a white peace with the NCR or CES then resets the timer for war.
    - Defeating when controlling Flagstaff or when the Legion has splintered can end war taking some
      territory and giving CES a debuff, resetting the timer (the timer will be that all CES
      successors declare war if they exist).
    - Can back a specific CES successor for all others to declare war, significantly increasing timer.
- Enclave: After Enclave has beaten NCR creates mission that ticks down to war.
    - Working with Enclave, can have TNK and Enclave guarantee each other (this disallows white peace option)
    - Split with Enclave, if Shady Sands and (some other territory) is controlled by TNK and Enclave
      offers decisions to end war early splitting NCR territory.
    - If went good path and made progress can ally Enclave if they also went good path.
