# TNKD - Think Tank Defragmented

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3342313594

Think Tank submod for [Old World Blues](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2265420196).

## Update process

1. Get [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/)
2. Go through every file in the mod and compare to OWB files, resoling conflicts.
3. Play game to test.
4. Done.

## Plan

### High Priority

- add focuses for restoring mojave economically (that you can start as soon as you beat mojave chapter)
- add these guns https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Old_World_Blues_weapons
- balance `tnkd_next_steps` stability and war support requirements so they are difficult to meet and take some time and focus to get
- balance robo-scorpions and other units so think tank is forced to have a varied army e.g. also using infantry (lobotomites).
- focus icons for attacking tar walkers and ouroboros are duplicated and wrong. Fix this.
- brain drain icon is broken and might not make sense to be added where its added
- decohesion idea image is broken
- lul seems to never train new units likely bug in base mod
- When NCR/CES refuses/accepts to return land it should trigger an event that communicates this rather than the affect happening silently (e.g. they could refuse and someone doesn't notice the border war mission is now avaible).

### Medium Priority

- G.E.V should have a nice decision category image
- the carrot focus should trigger an event for each neighbour where we can decide if we want to give them the offer (it doesn't make sense to give an evil faction the offer)
- update ncr and ces peace deal decisions to instead be missions which start when capturing capitols then when timing out trigger the peace deal event (where you choose if peace)
- should add 1 more focus and/or mission before giving claim against each small neighbor that allows a mission to destabilize them so you can beat them early and early war is more viable
- vegas platinum chip focus should require that vegas has completed their platinum chip focus (or has it via some other check)
- need to add more motivation to engage in earlier wars and have fun as tnk should add extra expeditions which need wars and gives clear good rewards
- add content that is works with the enclave mod
  - if player is playing enclave have think tank spawn, take-over mojave from whoever (brotherhood, ncr, ceasar, vegas) and basically be a very strong turtley vegas that blocks enclave from hoover dam making their life a bit harder, maybe also add fun decisions category.
  - if player is think tank they can follow a focus sub-tree that decides whether to fight or work with enclave

### Low Priority

- Make AI Think Tank more interesting
  - Always beats Mojave Brotherhood
  - Spawn with more units
  - Code AI path through focus tree
  - Possibly give AI buffs not given to players
- add decisions that allow temporarily occupying territory for expeditions without declaring war
- add more NCR/CES targeted buffs for TNK to help win but not be op
- a new countries (aliens, dwemer and vikings) for expeditions paths
- add NCR and CES war reparation as a mission that decrease industry/military given to TNK over time and they can take decisions to decrease it more.
- use better decisions/mission icons
- should add idea to NCR and CES that prevents them manually declaring war on TNK, should remove after mission timer runs out
- should add later focus after allying vegas that allows backstabbing them
- add more narrative events, could add a diplomatic tree where you send crazy robots to annoy other people and give them small debuffs or buffs could be funny
- allying Vegas should give them robotics buff due to think tank knowledge
- when ces or ncr no longer exists the decisions category for each shouldn't appear
