 # Focuses
 # -------------------------------------------
 lul_1:0 "Semper Idem"
 lul_1_desc:0 ""Always the Same"\nWe have been reborn from the light of Luna, warriors shown true purpose through conflict. Caesar was misguided, yet he strove towards something great. We must achieve what he has started - we must serve the moon and fight for the glory of the true Roman state!"

 lul_carthage:0 "Carthago Delenda Est"
 lul_carthage_desc:0 ""Carthage Must Be Destroyed"\nCarthage has always stood as the true enemy of Rome, a vile pretender to the title of master of the world. We must salt their fields once again."

 lul_hellenics:0 "Visio Dei"
 lul_hellenics_desc:0 ""Vision of a God"\nThe priests of Delphi were always known for their oracles. Perhaps if we were to find one they could help us reach communion with Luna? We must strike at them!"

 lul_conversion:0 "Exitus Acta Probat"
 lul_conversion_desc:0 ""The result justifies the deed"\nThe moon light brings the dead back from the dead - the harness she gives is what brings us life. We must strike down our former brothers, for that is the only way that they can be shown the truth in the moon goddess's wisdom."

 lul_hero_legends:0 "Acta Non Verba"

 lul_equipment:0 "Virtute Et Armis"
 lul_equipment_desc:0 ""By virtue and arms"\nLuna might give us the light to move, yet it is her harnesses that let us move. We do not know where they come from - whenever we speak in prayer they seem to materialize, as if summoned from the sky itself. We shall, through prayer be gifted enough harnesses to bring all of the old world under our united vision."

 lul_trade:0 "Sequere Pecuniam"

 lul_lunar_wealth:0 "Silentium Est Aureum"
 lul_lunar_wealth_desc:0 ""Silence is Golden"\nThe city of gold will not be a city of trade, but a city of wealth. A testament to humanity's failure and our success through the destruction of the thing they held close to their heart."

 lul_stadium_of_the_dead:0 "Ab Aeterno"
 lul_stadium_of_the_dead_desc:0 ""From The Eternal"\nWe are capable of fighting forever, we must construct a stadium to put this gift to use! We will build a stadium where every night Luna can watch our fights for glory and piety."

 lul_cult_of_luna:0 "Astra inclinant"
 lul_cult_of_luna_desc:0 ""The Stars Incline Us"\nWe are but supplicants to her wisdom - for she is the one that brought us back from the dead and gave us life anew. We must ensure that we never forget her wisdom, the wisdom of the great Luna - the moon goddess."
