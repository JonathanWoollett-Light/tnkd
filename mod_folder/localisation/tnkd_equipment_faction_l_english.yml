  TNK_robot_scurry_tech_desc:0 "The original robo-scorpion was created before the Great War by Dr. Mobius and his team in the X-42 robo-warfare facility in Big MT, based on scorpions and powered by a fission battery. They were created for security at the Big Mountain Research and Development Center as robotic guardians with a tail-mounted energy bolt blaster, optical systems allowing anyone operating them to see through them with monitors, and a self-destruct sequence which, after system failure causes them to explode."
